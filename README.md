## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the Big Mart Sales Prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict the sales of various products in different outlets of Big Mart. The sales predictions can help the company optimize its inventory and distribution processes, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.

## Introduction

Big Mart is a leading retail chain with stores in different locations. With a large product inventory, it becomes crucial for the company to predict the sales for each product in their various outlets. This prediction task can help in restocking products more effectively, reducing wastage, and ultimately maximizing revenue.

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of products based on historical sales data, product attributes, and outlet information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found in the `data` directory. It contains two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

- `train.csv` - This file contains the training data that includes features such as product ID, product weight, outlet location, outlet size, etc., along with the corresponding sales data.

- `test.csv` - This file contains the test data with similar features as the training data, except for the sales data, which needs to be predicted using the developed model.

## Installation

To run the code locally or to reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/big-mart-sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```
   cd big-mart-sales-prediction
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. The data is already included in the `data` directory, but if you need to update it with newer data, replace the CSV files with your dataset.

## Usage

To train the model and make predictions on the test data, you can use the provided Python scripts. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment if you created one.

1. **Training:**

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

   This script will read the training data, preprocess it, train the predictive model, and save the trained model to a file for later use.

2. **Prediction:**

   ```
   python predict.py
   ```

   This script will load the trained model, process the test data, make predictions, and save the results to a CSV file.

## Model

The predictive model used in this project is a machine learning algorithm (you can mention the specific model like Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., if known) that has been chosen based on its performance on the given task. The model is trained using the training data and then evaluated on the test data to generate predictions.

For more details about the model architecture and hyperparameters, refer to the `train.py` script.

## Results

After training the model and making predictions, the results will be available in the `predictions.csv` file. This file will contain the predicted sales values for the test data.

Additionally, the performance metrics and evaluation results of the model can be found in the project's wiki or the `results.md` file.
